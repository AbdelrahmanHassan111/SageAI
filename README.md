## 🖼️ Framework Architecture

### 1️⃣ **Input Layer: Document Upload**  
   - **📂 Upload Documents**: Users upload PDFs or text files.
   - **📜 Text Extraction**: Extracts text using libraries like `PyPDF2` or OCR tools for scanned documents.

### 2️⃣ **Processing Layer: Text Preparation**  
   - **📏 Chunking**: Splits long documents into manageable sections for efficient processing.
   - **🔗 Embedding Generation**: Creates contextual embeddings using **sentence-transformers**.

### 3️⃣ **Indexing Layer: FAISS**  
   - **⚡ Semantic Indexing**: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) indexes embeddings for fast and accurate similarity search.
   - **📖 Query Matching**: Matches user queries with the most relevant document sections.

### 4️⃣ **Query Layer: Interaction**  
   - **❓ User Queries**: Accepts natural language questions.
   - **🔍 Chunk Retrieval**: Identifies the best-matching sections from the indexed embeddings.

### 5️⃣ **Response Layer: Summarization & Chat**  
   - **🧠 Summarization**: Uses fine-tuned Pegasus models for abstractive summaries of retrieved content.
   - **💬 Conversational Output**: Generates natural language answers for seamless interaction.
